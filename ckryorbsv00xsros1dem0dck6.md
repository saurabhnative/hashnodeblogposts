## Good software engineering practices -  part 2

Hello everyone who is reading this article. I'm going to share a few programming tips which I have learnt from my day to day job on my own and from my colleagues in the hopes that it benefits other developers working in the industry as well.

So let's begin with the first tip in this article:

- ## Only focus on a single bug fix or feature development at a time

Whenever we are creating a project, we should make sure that we are working on a single feature or a single bug fix at a time. The reason for this is because, let's just say if you work on multiple features or multiple fixes at the same time, you might miss the deadlines for all of them, or you might not be able to make sufficient progress on any of them because you are trying to do too many things at a time. So the advice for today is, whenever you are working professionally, always try to pick up a single bug fix or a single feature development before you move on to the next feature or next bug fix. This will keep your progress on track and make sure that you are making deployments on your project consistently.

Just in case, if it happens, that you need to work on something urgently. Then, one or two features or two fixes concurrently at a time are okay, but make sure that not everything is on high priority and that you have sufficient time to finish or work on a single feature or bug fix before you move on to the next one.

- ## Avoid deployments to production on Friday or near to end of the workday

Always try to avoid doing deployments to production on Fridays or towards the end of your workday. The reason for this is if there is any bug that is not handled in your code changes, you might have to work extra on your weekends or after the end of your work time. That is why it is advisable to do deployments to production usually towards the first four days of the week, and towards the start of your workday or the middle of it, so that you have sufficient time to handle any missed bugs or miss issues. And that way, your life stays simple and easy. If you're a manager who follows this practice, then that's a great thing to do in the company.
