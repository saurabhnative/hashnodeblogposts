## 10 useful sections to improve your Github README files

# Hello everyone
Today we are going to cover a list of 10 important sections you can add to your GitHub projects for improving your README files.

So let's begin...

### Section 1: Add title, description and socialify image(optional)
The title and description for a Github project can provide the user with basic information about the project.
Additionally, we can create a project info image using  [socialify](https://socialify.git.ci/)  service to improve project presentation.  
Example:-

 [Socialify](https://socialify.git.ci/)  helps you showcase your project to the world by generating a beautiful project image that can be used in Github README

### Section 2: Add shields io badges
 [Shields.io](https://shields.io/) is a service for creating legible badges in SVG format, which can easily be included in GitHub readmes or any other web page.
This will help to provide project information in a condensed manner:-

### Section 3: Project Demo
Project demo URL helps the viewer to see live projects easily. We can also use this to show live previews to prospective interviewers quickly during interviews.  
Example:-

### Section 4: Project Screenshots
Project screenshots help users to see the product even before opening the live demo link. For frontend/full-stack projects this is a must-have section.  
Example:-
