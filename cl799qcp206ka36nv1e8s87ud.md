## Why the next popular Metaverse could be a game like GTA 5?

Recently I came across an article about GTA roleplay and how some gamers spend most of their day-to-day life within the game playing out as characters with deep intricate stories. 
GTA 5 RP can be considered a modified version of GTA Online where people play different characters and stories on modded servers.  
 
It has gained massive popularity among players online and is of the most viewed games on Twitch. Players love GTA RP because it’s as realistic as it gets. For example, you have to pass a written and practical driving test to get your license. Then, you must respect the rules of the road to avoid getting a ticket. The police community is pretty strict about people following laws and restricts people from unlawful behaviour.
There are court cases happening for rule breakers and some of them gain massive viewership as well.
You can get a job or start your own business to live a fulfilling lawful life.
 
Most servers also give players the ability to buy a house and furnish it to their liking. In fact, some even roleplay as a landlord and rent out a property to other players for a certain amount of in-game money.
GTA 5 has a massive open world and gives players a plethora of options to start out as a unique in-game character with its own story.

One of the best parts of GTA 5 is the driving and it gets taken up a notch in GTA RP. Many servers have made changes to the driving system, from simple handling tweaks to importing real-life vehicles into the game.

There are lakhs of players playing concurrently on GTA RP servers and this has given rise to a huge community of gamers as well as game stream viewers. Additionally, there’s usually something interesting happening every day, from concerts and comedy, shows to car shows and dance parties, which keeps players engaged and interested.

This is pretty close to the vision of Metaverse which popular articles today mention online. My calculated guess is that the most popular metaverses in future might not be from social media platforms but from open-world online games with huge communities since they have the below points:-

- Open-world online games like GTA mimic real-world architecture, people and communities more closely than any other software or hardware available today.
- Most cutting-edge VR/XR hardware is easy to integrate with such games
- People find it easy to navigate and communicate with each other via open-world games.
- There won't be much effort to gain an initial audience for these games since the gamer community is pretty massive and popular games like GTA find it easier to attract them to their platform.
